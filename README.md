#Collaborative code reviews
This repo was created to keep track of new ideas for making the best out of communal code reviews here at [Makers] (www.makersacademy.com).
This document will hopeully evolve as more and more members of Makers have their say. It is originally created by and for the May 2016 cohort.

##Format
Code reviews are normally held on a Monday morning, working on the weekend challenge with peer to peer reviews first and then communally reviewing a few people's code, which is shared with everyone and discussed.

##Motivation
At the time this is written a number of students find it difficult to dive into someone else's code base and focus on details in a short period of time. Most of us, as novice developers, would rather have a few minutes ahead of the collaborative review to become familiar with the architecture of the solutions that are going to be discussed. This would also help the community come up with relevant, useful and constructive questions/comments.

##Selection
As a community, we would like to try select people whose code will be communally reviewed ahead of time, so that everyone else can have a look at their code ahead of time.

There are a number of ways in which people could be selected. One option is listed below. More will be added to discuss, unless everyone is happy with the one proposed.

###Option 1
####Reviews master
Each week a person will be randomly selected to be in charge of arranging reviews the following Monday.

####Random Selection
This person will then select 6 random people who have not reviewied their code before and let them know privately that they have been selected. People are free to decline if they do not feel like it. For any person who declines, the reviews master should randomly pick another one who has not yet reviewed (or if everyone else has reviewed then move onto people who have only revied once and so forth) until 6 people are selected.

These people are then publicly announced so that everyone can have a look at their code ahead of the reviews.

####Code review
Should any of the 6 not be able to share their code due to time restraints, they will automatically be signed up for the next session (though can decline if they want to).
